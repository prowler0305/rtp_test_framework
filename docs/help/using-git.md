# Using Git/GitHub

### Description:

From Wikipedia:

***Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version control system that is widely used for software development and other version control tasks.
It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.***

***GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management
(SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool,
GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration.
It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests,
task management, and wikis for every project.***

`git add` -> Stages local changes to be committed.

`git commit` -> Commits changes locally.

`git push` -> Commits locally committed changes to the remove repository.
